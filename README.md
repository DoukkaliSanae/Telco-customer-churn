# Telco-customer-churn
Predicting customer churn is critical for telecommunication companies to be able to effectively retain customers. It is more costly to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. For this reason, large telecommunications corporations are seeking to develop models to predict which customers are more likely to change and take actions accordingly.

we build a model to predict how likely a customer will churn by analyzing its characteristics: (1) demographic information, (2) account information, and (3) services information. The objective is to obtain a data-driven solution that will allow us to reduce churn rates and, as a consequence, to increase customer satisfaction and corporation revenue.

# Data set
The data set used in this article is available in the Kaggle (CC BY-NC-ND) and contains nineteen columns (independent variables) that indicate the characteristics of the clients of a fictional telecommunications corporation. The Churn column (response variable) indicates whether the customer departed within the last month or not. The class No includes the clients that did not leave the company last month, while the class Yes contains the clients that decided to terminate their relations with the company. The objective of the analysis is to obtain the relation between the customerâ€™s characteristics and the churn.
